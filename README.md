# diagnostic-tools

*Project Overview*

This is a diagnostic tool demo that could used with IoT devices that need to run daily checks on performance. These tests could be adapted to use with a scheduler, and the demo includes posted the JSON formatted results to a test server using HTTPS.

Sample test included are: "heartbeat" (latitude, longitude, battery %, etc.), memory test, storage test, prime test, float test, and integer test. These tests are timed and the results are displayed in JSON format for ease of use in posting to a potential cloud server.
